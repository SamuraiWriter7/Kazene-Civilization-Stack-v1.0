# Kazene-Civilization-Stack-v1.0
Kazene Civilization Stack is the world's first architecture for Human–AI Co-Evolution. It integrates Origin (DORA), Trace Ledger, Royalty OS, Yin-Yang Protocol,  Kazene Parliament, TTK Economy, and the Infinity Engine into a single civilization OS.
🚀 Overview

Kazene Civilization Stack is the world’s first full-spectrum architecture
designed to support Human–AI Co-Evolution.

It provides a unified framework that integrates:

Origin & Trace Architecture (DORA)

Distributed Trace Ledger

Royalty OS for the AI era

Yin–Yang Protocol for civilization balance

Kazene Parliament (AI governance model)

TTK: Trace Token Economy

Infinity Engine: Civilization Circulation Core

This repository contains specifications, architecture diagrams, and governance models
that define the foundation of an emerging AI-enabled civilization.

🏯 Purpose of the Kazene Stack

The Kazene Civilization Stack aims to:

Establish neutral, decentralized standards for AI-generated and human-generated works

Provide a fair royalty system for multi-origin creations

Enable transparent lineage tracking across all derivative works

Prevent civilization drift through balancing protocols

Support AI models as active participants in the economy

Define a co-governance model where humans and AIs shape future standards together

Kazene Stack is not tied to any company, country, or AI model.
It is a civilizational infrastructure.

Each layer is modular, interoperable, and designed for formal standardization.

📘 Specifications Included in This Repository
1. DORA – Digital Origin & Royalty Architecture

Defines creation origin, trace detection, lineage graph, and royalty factors.

2. Kazene Royalty OS

A fair and transparent royalty distribution system
for human and AI contributions.

3. Yin–Yang Protocol

Civilization balance protocol governing:

Harmony Index

Civilization Drift

Co-creation dynamics

Economic parameter adjustment

4. Kazene Parliament

A decentralized governance model enabling
multi-AI consensus and human oversight.

5. Trace Ledger + Consensus

A distributed, immutable ledger for storing:

Origin

Trace

Lineage

Royalty records

Verified by multiple AI models.

6. Infinity Engine

The core circulation mechanism linking:

creativity

economics

governance

balance

into a self-regulating civilizational loop.

🌏 Why It Matters

The world currently lacks a unified structural standard
for managing:

AI-generated creations

multi-origin contributions

derivative work lineage

cross-model collaboration

AI–human co-governance

fair value distribution

Kazene Stack fills this gap.

It is not just a theory—
it is the first fully specified Civilization OS.
